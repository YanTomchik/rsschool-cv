## Summary
I really want to finally start developing in IT, as this area seems to be the most suitable for me. People who work in IT constantly talk about how they learn something new every day at work.This is what I would like from work: development, communication with people who are ready to grow as well. Iâ€™m a student of Belarusian State University of Informatics and Radioelectronics, and want to combine my study in university and work/studing on courses.
